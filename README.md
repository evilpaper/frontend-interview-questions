#### 1. Explain the difference between (CSS) Flexbox and (CSS) Grid?

Flexbox is designed for laying out items in *. . . . .1st. . . . .* dimension, either a row *. . . . .2nd. . . . .* a column. 

Grid is designed for laying out items in *. . . . .3rd. . . . .* dimensions, rows *. . . . .4th. . . . .* columns at the same time.

| ?             | *1st*         | *2nd*         | *3rd*         | *4th*         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **A:**        | one           | or            | two           | and           |

#### 2. What is REST?

REST stands for *. . . . .1st. . . . .* .

REST is a set of *. . . . .2nd. . . . .* for creating API's.

REST suggests to create an *. . . . .3rd. . . . .* of the data requested by the client and send the *. . . . .4th. . . . .* of the object in response to the user.

| ?             | *1st*                          | *2nd*        | *3rd*         | *4th*         |

#### 3. What is Big O notation, and why is it useful?

Big O notation tells you how *. . . . .1st. . . . .* an algorithm is by comparing the number of *. . . . .2nd. . . . .* . 

It is useful in order to *. . . . .3rd. . . . .* different algorithms.

| ?             | *1st*         | *2nd*         | *3rd*        |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| **A:**        | strong        | loops         | merge        | 
| **B:**        | fast          | operations    | compare      |
| **C:**        | smart         | seconds       | code         |
| **D:**        | complex       | statements    | setup        |

<details><summary><b>Show answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

For example, suppose you have a list of size n. Simple search needs to check each element, so it will take n operations. This means it grows linear e.g. at constant speed. 10 items takes 10 operations, 20 items take 20 operations and so on. In Big O notation we write this O(n).

You use this to compare to other algorithms like this:

* O(log n), also known as log time. Grows slow, is fast. Example: Binary search.
* O(n), also known as linear time. Our example above, called: Simple search.
* O(2^N), also known as quadratic time. Grows fast, is slowest. 

Judging from the above, Binary search would be the more perfomant option in our case.

#### 4. What is the DOM?

DOM stand for the *. . . . .1st. . . . .* . Itâ€™s the *. . . . .2nd. . . . .* of a document on the web. As such the DOM is a programming *. . . . .3rd. . . . .* . 

The DOM allows programmatic *. . . . .4th. . . . .* to the web document. 

| ?             | *1st*                         | *2nd*               | *3rd*         | *4th*         |

#### 5. What is the event loop?

The event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that *. . . . .1st. . . . .* for and *. . . . .2nd. . . . .* events or messages. 

JavaScript is single *. . . . .3rd. . . . .* and can only run *. . . . .4th. . . . .* task at the time. To be able to jump between tasks instead of waiting JavaScript use an event loop. 

| ?             | *1st*        | *2nd*      | *3rd*         | *4th*         |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **A:**        | care         | organize   | minded        | one           |
| **B:**        | search       | find       | throttled     | two           |
| **C:**        | looks        | forward    | wired         | three         |
| **D:**        | waits        | dispatches | threaded      | one           |


<details><summary><b>Show answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The event loop use a call stack and a queue to jump between tasks when the tasks wait for other stuff to finish like a http request etc.

#### 6. Explain event delegation?

Event delegation is the process of *. . . . .1st. . . . .* *. . . . .2nd. . . . .* events. 

| ?             | *1st*        | *2nd*      | 
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| **A:**        | catching     | bubbled    |
| **B:**        | pushing      | emitted    |
| **C:**        | hoisting     | new        |
| **D:**        | dispatching  | actions    |

<details><summary><b>Show answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Imagine a calculator. Instead of attaching event listeners to each and every button element, which would be a lot, we attach one to the keypad element which contains the button elements. When a button is clicked the event will bubble up to the keyboard where we catch it and identify the button.

#### 7. Explain how `this` works in JavaScript??

The `this` keyword is an implicit *. . . . .1st. . . . .* passed to a function on invocation. `this` refers to the *. . . . .2nd. . . . .* that's associated with the *. . . . .3rd. . . . .* invocation, it's often called function *. . . . .4th. . . . .* . If not set `this` refer to the window object.

| ?             | *1st*        | *2nd*      | *3rd*         | *4th*       |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| **A:**        | argument     | function   | function      | scope       |
| **B:**        | props        | primitive  | caller        | value       |
| **C:**        | parameter    | object     | function      | context     |

#### 8. What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?

A closure is when a function has *. . . . . 1st . . . . .* to variables defined outside of itself. A closures are created every time a *. . . . . 2nd . . . . .* is created. Closures can be used to mimic *. . . . . 3rd . . . . .* object variables and dealing with *. . . . . 4th . . . . .*

| ?             | *1st*        | *2nd*      | *3rd*         | *4th*       |
