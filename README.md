#### 3. What is Big O notation, and why is it useful?

Big O notation tells you how .......... an algorithm is by comparing the number of .......... . 

It is useful in order to .......... different algorithms.

| ?             |               |               |              |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |

| **B:**        | fast          | operations    | compare      |
| **C:**        | smart         | seconds       | code         |
| **D:**        | complex       | statements    | setup        |

<details><summary><b>Show answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

For example, suppose you have a list of size n. Simple search needs to check each element, so it will take n operations. This means it grows linear e.g. at constant speed. 10 items takes 10 operations, 20 items take 20 operations and so on. In Big O notation we write this O(n).

You use this to compare to other algorithms like this:

* O(log n), also known as log time. Grows slow, is fast. Example: Binary search.
* O(n), also known as linear time. Our example above, called: Simple search.
* O(2^N), also known as quadratic time. Grows fast, is slowest. 

Judging from the above, Binary search would be the more perfomant option in our case.

#### 6. Explain event delegation?

Event delegation is the process of ........ ........ events. 

| ?             |              |            |

#### Answer: A

Imagine a calculator. Instead of attaching event listeners to each and every button element, which would be a lot, we attach one to the keypad element which contains the button elements. When a button is clicked the event will bubble up to the keyboard where we catch it and identify the button.
