#### 3. What is Big O notation, and why is it useful?

#### Answer: B

For example, suppose you have a list of size n. Simple search needs to check each element, so it will take n operations. This means it grows linear e.g. at constant speed. 10 items takes 10 operations, 20 items take 20 operations and so on. In Big O notation we write this O(n).

You use this to compare to other algorithms like this:

* O(log n), also known as log time. Grows slow, is fast. Example: Binary search.
* O(n), also known as linear time. Our example above, called: Simple search.
* O(2^N), also known as quadratic time. Grows fast, is slowest. 

Judging from the above, Binary search would be the more perfomant option in our case.
